This folder may contain client-side consent helpers (placeholder).

In a real deployment you would:
- Load your CMP / consent library here (e.g., OneTrust, Cookiebot, homegrown).
- Map toggles (analytics/marketing) to actual script loading logic.
- Respect Do Not Track / GPC as required in your jurisdictions.
